    "Looking at the Landsat images in December 2017 and January 2018, provides more information on how the polygons were delineated. Indeed, owing to the revisit time of Landsat (14 days) and cloud cover, some of the deforestation events that happened end of December 2017 (as we saw in the Sentinel-2 images) were missed. The Landsat acquisition on 17<sup>th</sup> January 2018 provides more insight into the timing of the deforestation. Nevertheless, two of the polygon were already partly deforested in December 2017, which could mean that the dataset contains operator errors. The images also show that the 31<sup>st</sup> January 2018 indicated in the dataset is an arbitrary date representing the entire month of January."
